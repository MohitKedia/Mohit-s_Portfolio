# [Project 2 : Case-Study-on-Hotel-Booking-Price](https://github.com/MohitKedia/Case-Study-on-Hotel-Booking-Price)

*Primary goal of launching a new feature on Agoda website is to increase the number of bookings. One way to increase the number of bookings and conversion rate is to encourage customers to complete their booking as fast as possible. The call to action message that helps us to achieve that is internally known as an ‘urgency message’*.

*A Product Owner (PO) would like to implement an urgency message on the website such as*

*“Prices have been rising. Book now to lock in your rates!”
“Your check-in is fast approaching. Book now to lock in your rates!”
He/she is requesting you to perform an analysis in order to understand the movement of the price as the day approaches the check-in date. Attached is a randomly sampled booking data from five different cities with check-in between 10/10/2016 – 12/31/2016*.

*Please analyze the data and prepare a presentation in any format of preference (i.e. powerpoint, keynote, or pdf). You will have 30 minutes to present to the PO and some of the team's developers including time for their questions*.

*Some things to think about*

*At which part of the funnel should this message be implemented? On a homepage, search results page, at the property level, or booking form?
What assumptions are you making about the data?
What factors play a role on price in this analysis?
What other factors may influence the analysis that isn’t available in the dataset? What would improve the analysis?
What conclusions can you draw from the data?
What recommendations would you give to the Product Owner?
There is no limitation to any tools and technology for this analysis*.

*Data Dictionary*

*ADR – Average Daily Rate in US Dollars (Customer Total Amount / Room Nights) Hotel ID – Property identification number City ID – City identification number Star rating – Property’s star rating Accommodation Type Name – Property’s accommodation type Chain Hotel – Indicates whether the property is part of a chain or not Booking date – Date of booking made Check-in date – Date of check-in Check-out date – Date of check-out*

# [Project 3 : Levers-Vs-Indicators-Analysis](https://github.com/MohitKedia/Levers-Vs-Indicators-Analysis)

**Step 1 : The Problem statement for this project is to understand the factors or levers that impact session rating and session completion rate in live online interactive sessions**

*Step 2 : After knowing the problem statement, I had coordinated with Business or Content Team to understand key metrics or X variables that can impact the Y variables. Some of the x metrics are attendance%,#avg chat per user, #doubts asked, #quizzes asked,%quiz accuracy, %quiz attempt, %students who rated class slides as great, %doubts resolved and some of the y metrics are session rating, session completion rate and like dislike ratio.*

**Step 3 : After getting all metrics, I did data extraction by writing complex SQL queries using Window functions, CTEs, Joins and subqueries on Metabase and Amazon Redshift for which I coordinated with Multiple teams including Tech, Analytics and Product**

*Step 4 : After extracting the data, I performed data visualization and interactive dashboard to get hidden trends or insights*

**Step 5 : After getting insights, I had recommended few solutions to the business team,Content and Product Team to make few changes and we were able to improve session completion rate by 30%**
