# [Project 2 : Case-Study-on-Hotel-Booking-Price](https://github.com/MohitKedia/Case-Study-on-Hotel-Booking-Price)

*Primary goal of launching a new feature on Agoda website is to increase the number of bookings. One way to increase the number of bookings and conversion rate is to encourage customers to complete their booking as fast as possible. The call to action message that helps us to achieve that is internally known as an ‘urgency message’*.

*A Product Owner (PO) would like to implement an urgency message on the website such as*

*“Prices have been rising. Book now to lock in your rates!”
“Your check-in is fast approaching. Book now to lock in your rates!”
He/she is requesting you to perform an analysis in order to understand the movement of the price as the day approaches the check-in date. Attached is a randomly sampled booking data from five different cities with check-in between 10/10/2016 – 12/31/2016*.

*Please analyze the data and prepare a presentation in any format of preference (i.e. powerpoint, keynote, or pdf). You will have 30 minutes to present to the PO and some of the team's developers including time for their questions*.

*Some things to think about*

*At which part of the funnel should this message be implemented? On a homepage, search results page, at the property level, or booking form?
What assumptions are you making about the data?
What factors play a role on price in this analysis?
What other factors may influence the analysis that isn’t available in the dataset? What would improve the analysis?
What conclusions can you draw from the data?
What recommendations would you give to the Product Owner?
There is no limitation to any tools and technology for this analysis*.
